                <h2>How does solar panles work ?</h2>
                <p>The working principle of solar panels is to cause photons or light particles to separate electrons from atoms, thereby generating electric current. Solar panels actually consist of many smaller units called photovoltaic cells. Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich composed of two pieces of semiconductor material (usually silicon).</p>
                <p>In order to work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field. Just like a magnetic field due to opposite polarity, an electric field is also generated when opposite charges are separated. To enter this field, manufacturers "doped" silicon with other materials to make each piece of the sandwich positively or negatively charged.</p>

                <h2>How does Charge Controller work ?</h2>
                <p>Think of the solar charge controller as a regulator. It supplies power from the photovoltaic array to the system load and battery pack. When the battery pack is about to run out, the controller will gradually reduce the charging current to maintain the required voltage to fully charge the battery and make it fully charged</p>
                <p>What is becoming more and more complex is energy storage for use when the sun is not glowing or the grid is not working. To store electrical energy to complete useful work in the future, the battery needs to be connected to the solar photovoltaic system. After the battery is added, the charge controller will become one of the most important system components.</p>

                <h2>How does Battery system work?</h2>
                <p>The battery storage system usually consists of three main components:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A battery that contains individual battery cells connected together that can be discharged and charged with DC voltage</li>
                    <li>The inverter-charger unit can convert the direct current of the battery into alternating current and convert the alternating current into direct current so as to charge the battery from the mains</li>
                    <li>The balance of system components, such as wiring, battery management systems, and other measurement and control components</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Battery manufacturers and suppliers offer a range of different products, which may require different levels of system integration and installation work.</p>

                <h2>What is DC power and what it is used for ?</h2>
                <p>Direct current (DC) is a one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. Electrochemical batteries are the main example of DC power sources.</p>
                <p>The most common sources of direct current are solar cells, batteries and thermocouples. DC power supplies are widely used in low voltage applications, such as rechargeable batteries, automotive applications, aircraft applications and other low voltage, low current applications. Today, all solar panels can generate by DC power</p>

                <h2>How does inverter work ?</h2>
                <p>A power inverter or inverter is a power electronic device or circuit that converts direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC).</p>
                <p>The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of a particular device or circuit. The inverter does not generate electricity; the power is provided by a DC power source.</p>
                <p>Power inverters are mainly used in power applications where high current and high voltage exist. Circuits that perform the same function on electronic signals (usually with very low current and voltage) are called oscillators. The circuit that converts alternating current to direct current and performs the opposite function is called a rectifier</p>

            <article id = "article6">
                <h2>What is AC power and what it is used for ?</h2>
                <p>Alternating Current (Ac), can be generated using equipment called alternators. This device is a special type of generator designed to generate alternating current</p>
                <p>The coil rotates inside the magnetic field, and a current is induced along the coil. The rotation of wires can come from many ways: wind turbines, steam turbines, flowing water, etc. Since the wire periodically rotates and enters different magnetic poles, the voltage and current on the wire alternately change</p>
                <p>Alternating current is used to power houses, office buildings, etc.</p>
